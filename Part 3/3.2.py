# ================= Calculations (Split vs Combine) =================
#
# Example: Formatting a string to 20 chars with '*' padding
# 
# --------Rule of thumb for Python beginners----------
# Ask yourself: “Would someone reading this for the first time immediately understand what’s happening?”
# If yes → combining is okay.
# If no → split into meaningful variables with clear names.
#
# ---------------- Split calculation ----------------
# string = "python"
# padding = 20 - len(string)       # calculate number of '*' separately
# stars   = "*" * padding          # build the padding string
# formatted_string = stars + string
# print(formatted_string)
#
# Advantages:
# - Each step is clear and named
# - Easy to debug intermediate values
# - Easier to modify or extend later
#
# ---------------- Combine calculation ----------------
# string = "python"
# formatted_string = "*" * (20 - len(string)) + string
# print(formatted_string)
#
# Advantages:
# - Shorter
# - Works for simple cases
#
# Disadvantages:
# - Harder to read if expression is complex
# - No intermediate values to debug
#
# Rule of Thumb:
# - Split for clarity and maintainability
# - Combine for short, obvious expressions
